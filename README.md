## Description

_Welcome to my second independent project as a student at
[Epicodus](https://epicodus.com)!_

[The
lesson](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/box-model)
from [the curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com) for this page was originally assigned for pair programming during class time on Wednesday January 5th 2022. We didn't get to it and had to move on to the next topic. I went through it later on my own starting on Friday the 14th. Check out more of my work at:
